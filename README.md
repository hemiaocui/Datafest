OCR, text extraction
In this project, I used Python-tesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) tool to analyze wine catalog images. Here are the benefits I learned from this project: 
1. A generic algorithm was developed to extract the wine number, price per bottle, price per case as well as wine name. It obtains high accuracy in several images. The algorithm is more robust to wine number and price, but not so robust in terms of wine name. 
2. Robustness can be improved using NLP, machine learning, OCR preprocssing to obtain tables.
